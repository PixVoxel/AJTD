It also lacks the required matrix that a Collector Crystal possesses to gather Starlight efficiently, and due to this is unable to compensate for atmospheric diffusion of Starlight energy. Measurements by the Academy indicate sea level is roughly the mid-point in diffusion losses, with bedrock showing nearly full diffusion loss of the energies. Atmospheric diffusion losses disappear at around twice the distance from bedrock as sea level itself.",

  "astralsorcery.constellation.gelu.enchantments": "This constellation saturates potions to grant Resistance to damage and fire, but may Slow the imbiber. Enchanted boots can Freeze the surface of water walked on and reduce falling damage. Enchanted items are less likely to break through use.<NL>Enchanted armor may improve the strength of worn enchantments, digging tools may have greater reach, and weapons may have more powerful critical hits.",
  "astralsorcery.constellation.gelu.trait": "As the insidious cold diminishes output with its deep chill, so too does it spread wide its embrace, increasing the reach of a ritual nearly four times over, but reducing its strength to nearly one sixth.",

  "astralsorcery.constellation.alcara.enchantments": "This constellation saturates potions to greatly boost the imbiber's Luck, make them Invisible in plain sight, and increase their movement Speed. Enchanted fishing rods are more effective in all ways, tools gentle in touch, swords far more destructive to a target's allies, and crossbows far easier to reload.<NL>Armor may increase the length of a wearer's Rampage, melee weapons may leave bleeding wounds, and projectiles may fly far faster.",
